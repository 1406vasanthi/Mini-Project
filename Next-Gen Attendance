Next-Gen Attendance
The Next-Gen Attendance System is an automated solution that leverages computer vision and the face_recognition library and  presents a higher-level, simplified interface for face detection and recognition to streamline the traditional attendance marking process in educational institutions. The system uses facial recognition to identify students and automatically records their attendance in real-time, integrating with the institution's timetable system. This modern approach eliminates manual attendance tracking, reduces administrative overhead, and prevents proxy attendance while providing accurate, easily accessible attendance records.
Traditional attendance management systems in educational institutions rely heavily on manual processes, which are time-consuming, error-prone, and susceptible to proxy attendance. The Next-Gen Attendance System modernizes this process by implementing an automated, accurate, and efficient solution using facial recognition technology. The system captures student attendance through a camera, processes the facial data in real-time, and maintains digital records that can be easily accessed and analyzed
